# ABShelfLife
 ABShelfLife is a minimal Alpine-based Docker image that adds long-term, user-specific history tracking to Audiobookshelf. It uses s6-overlay, LinuxServer.io-style standards, Docker security best practices, FILE__ secrets support, MariaDB with local mount backups, and two-way sync via the Audiobookshelf API.
